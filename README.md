# Hangul-Trainer
**A small program to teach the Korean alphabet.** <br p>
*This program does _**not**_ cover Batchim rules, so readings may be subject to change on an exception basis.

## Installation / Use
After installing the 5 script files, namely:
 
  - hangultrainer.py (main script)
  - OptionsBranchFunctions.py
  - OptionsBranchFunctionsJP.py
  - hangulcharacters.py
  - menusandtextblocks.py

and move them into a single directory.
You can then open your terminal (either directly from the folder on mac), and input the following: <br />
 ```cd (directory name)``` -> ```python3 hangultrainer.py``` (if python version 3+). 
 This will allow you to access the directory from the terminal which allows the program to run.

 Furthermore, you can check your Python version by inputting either <br />
 ```python --version``` or  ```python3 --version``` 
 into the terminal.
