# Hangul-Trainer
**A small program to teach the Korean alphabet.**

*This program does _**not**_ cover Batchim rules, so readings may be subject to change on an exception basis.


Project Summary:
  - After running user is prompted to select between English and Japanese.
  - The user is then prompted to select a learning menu, credits, or return. Returning out of the language selection menu will stop the program.
  - Upon selecting the learning menu, the user has 5 options. Each option will produce a specific type of character (vowel, consonant, etc) at random.
  - User is prompted to guess and is awarded 1 point if correct, 0 if incorrect. "stop" can be entered at anytime to stop the learning loop.
  - Final score will be displayed when "stop" is entered.

This is my first practical project that I have made, so the code might be rather disorganized and a bit messy. Some parts are repeated or redundant I am sure.
If there are any bugs or fixes you would like to make, please do so and let me know. I am open to learning.

You need all 5 ".py" files included in the initial repository to run the program as I import between them to make sure my main script was easy to follow.
If you happen to stumble upon this page please give it a try.
